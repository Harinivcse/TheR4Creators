            Most of the non-biodegradable products (especially the products in unusable 
            condition) are not disposed in an efficient way, thus causing deterioration of 
            environment. So, to eliminate this problem and to provide a pristine and greener 
            environment we have designed an Online Marketplace for buying and selling 
            recyclable and reusable products. Due to dawn and domination of internet and 
            technology, the smart cities use innovative technologies to improve efficiency, 
            sustainability and cleanliness in the environment. Thus, this solution would be 
            an easy and clever way to help out the users to maintain an immaculate 
            environment. The users can either post an advert to sell their product or view 
            the products and its details posted by other users. And this application 
            recommends users a wide range of products based on his/her personal interest. At 
            times the user might not be able to view the product for the category he chose, 
            because the product might not be currently available but later someone might 
            post an advert satisfying the user needs. To overcome this drawback, the users 
            can lodge a request for the product he wants, and specify his needs via an 
            engaging chatbot. The products are being categorized as i) e-waste ii) plastic 
            iii) glass iv) construction materials v) metals vi) others which are further 
            being sub categorized from where the user can choose a product. Once the user 
            changes his mind and does not want to sell his product or if the user is done 
            with the deal, he has options to delete the advert he had posted for that 
            product to avoid further calls, messages and mails regarding that product. Most 
            of the scrap buyers do not accept all kinds of products, so such products 
            atrophy from lack of use, thus declining the greener environment. Thus, this app 
            is totally free allowing users to place their own classified advert for no 
            charge. The appealing factor is that this app serves as a “one stop shop” for 
            recyclable, reusable and refurbishable products thus enhancing a cleaner and 
            viridescent environment in a smart way.</p>
